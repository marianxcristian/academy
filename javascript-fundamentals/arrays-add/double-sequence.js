// Double Sequence

// Write a function doubleSequence that accepts a base and a length as arguments. 
// The function should return an array representing a sequence that contains "length" elements. 
// The first element of the sequence is always the "base", the subsequent elements can be generated by doubling the previous element of the sequence.

let doubleSequence = function (base, length) {
    if (length === 0) {
        return [];
    }

    let seq = [base];

    for (let i = 1; i < length; i++) {
        let last = seq[seq.length - 1];
        let next = last * 2;
        seq.push(next);
    }

    return seq;
};

console.log(doubleSequence(7, 3)); // [7, 14, 28]
console.log(doubleSequence(3, 5)); // [3, 6, 12, 24, 48]
console.log(doubleSequence(5, 3)); // [5, 10, 20]
console.log(doubleSequence(5, 4)); // [5, 10, 20, 40]
