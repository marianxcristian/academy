// Whisper

// Write a function whisper that takes in a string and returns a "whispered" version of that string.
// HINT: try using the .toLowerCase() method on a string to see what it does! You may also want to look up .toLowerCase() in the MDN documentation.

function whisper(str) {
    return "..." + str.toLowerCase() + "...";
}

console.log(whisper("Hey Buddy"));         // => "...hey buddy..."
console.log(whisper("YEA! that was fun")); // => "...yea! that was fun..."
